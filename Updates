I will be taking a small break from this project, only about two weeks or so, due to the end of school and that which is brought with it (Final exams, papers, projects, graduation, etc).
I hope that when I return to this project, I will be even better than before, and will be able to complete this project better than I would have previously.

Came back and completely reworked the site on CodePen based off of requirements from the Responsive Web Design course. Not sure if it is all correcet, but I will come back to it when I have both more knowledge and time.
